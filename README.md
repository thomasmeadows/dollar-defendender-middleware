# dollar-defender-middleware
Dollar defender middleware is express middleware protects against Dollar $ injection attacks for Sequelize, Waterline, and Mongoose

This is a very simple module that checks req.params, req.body and req.query for objects and recursively scans for the $ symbol as the first property key and responds with an error if it is detected.

The primary reason for this is because sometimes coders forget to write validators for route and this can be a huge security issue as described in this article at https://blog.websecurify.com/2014/08/hacking-nodejs-and-mongodb.html
